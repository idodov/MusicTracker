## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

1.  A working **Home Assistant** installation.
2.  The **[AppDaemon Add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-appdaemon)** installed and running.
3.  **(Optional)** A configured **Generative AI integration** (e.g., [Google Generative AI](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation/)) to enable the AI features.

### Step 1: Add the Script

1.  Navigate to your AppDaemon configuration folder (e.g., `/config/appdaemon/apps`).
2.  Create a new file inside the `apps` folder named `music_tracker.py`.
3.  Copy the entire content of the `music_tracker.py` script from this repository and paste it into your new file.

### Step 2: Configure `apps.yaml`

Open your `apps.yaml` file (in the `/config/appdaemon/apps` directory) and add the following block. Customize it to fit your setup.

```yaml
music_tracker:
  module: music_tracker
  class: MusicTracker
  
  # --- Required Settings ---
  # A list of all media_player entities you want to monitor.
  media_players:
    - media_player.living_room_sonos
    - media_player.kitchen_display
    - media_player.bedroom_speaker
    
  # The full path to the database file. Using the /config/ folder is recommended.
  db_path: "/config/music_data_history.db"

  # The full path where the final HTML page will be saved.
  # This MUST be inside your Home Assistant 'www' directory.
  html_output_path: "/config/www/music_charts.html"
  
  # --- AI & Chart Generation ---
  # The service call for your Generative AI integration. Set to false to disable.
  ai_service: "google_generative_ai_conversation/generate_content"
  
  # Time of day (24-hour HH:MM:SS format) to automatically update the charts.
  update_time: "23:59:00"

  # --- Database Optimization (Highly Recommended!) ---
  # Schedule to run the cleanup process.
  # This example runs every Sunday at 3:05 AM.
  cleanup_schedule: "03:05:00"
  cleanup_day_of_week: "sun"
  
  # Enable this to actually delete/prune records.
  # !! Run with 'false' first to see what would be cleaned in the logs !!
  cleanup_execute_on_run: false
  
  # Enable this to shrink the database file size after cleanup.
  cleanup_vacuum_on_complete: true

  # --- Fine-Tuning ---
  # How long a song must play (in seconds) to be counted.
  duration: 30
  
  # How many unique songs from an album must be played for it to appear.
  min_songs_for_album: 4

  # Set to true if you want the "Update Charts" button in the web interface.
  # See Step 3 below to set up the required automation.
  webhook: true
  
  # This is the helper toggle the script listens to for manual or webhook updates.
  chart_trigger_boolean: "input_boolean.music_charts_update"
  
  # Run the chart generation immediately when AppDaemon starts.
  run_on_startup: True
```

### Step 3: Set Up Manual & Webhook Updates (Optional)

To trigger updates from Home Assistant or from the chart page itself, you need a helper toggle and an automation.

#### A. Create a Helper Toggle

This toggle is the "switch" that tells the script to run an update.

1.  In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers**.
2.  Click **Create Helper** and select **Toggle**.
3.  Name it `Music Charts Update`. This creates an entity `input_boolean.music_charts_update`, which matches the `chart_trigger_boolean` in the config above.

You can now turn this toggle on anytime in Home Assistant to trigger an immediate update.

#### B. Create the Webhook Automation (For the Web Interface Button)

This automation connects the "Update Charts" button on the HTML page to the toggle you just created.

1.  Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes**.
2.  Click **Create Automation** and choose **Start with an empty automation**.
3.  Switch to **YAML mode** by clicking the three-dots menu in the top right.
4.  Paste the following YAML code and save it:

```yaml
alias: "Trigger Music Charts Update via Webhook"
description: "Listens for a webhook from the music chart page and turns on the update toggle."
trigger:
  - platform: webhook
    webhook_id: Update_Music_Charts # This ID must be exact
action:
  - service: input_boolean.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: input_boolean.music_charts_update # The helper you created
mode: single
```

**The update flow is now complete:** Button on HTML Page ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí Turns on Helper Toggle ‚Üí AppDaemon Script Runs.

## üñ•Ô∏è Viewing Your Charts

Once the script has run and generated the file, you can access your personal music charts at:

`http://<your-home-assistant-ip>:8123/local/music_charts.html`

-   Replace `<your-home-assistant-ip>` with the actual IP address or hostname of your Home Assistant instance.
-   Bookmark this page, or add it as a `webpage` card to one of your dashboards for easy access!

## üîß Database Maintenance Explained

Over time, your database can grow large. This script solves that problem automatically.

-   **Why cleanup is needed:** The `chart_history` table, used to calculate chart position changes (‚ñ≤/‚ñº), can grow to hundreds of megabytes. Also, quickly skipped songs can clutter your history.
-   **What the script does:**
    1.  **Deletes Skipped Songs:** Removes any entry that was played for less than the `cleanup_threshold_seconds`.
    2.  **Prunes Chart History:** Deletes historical chart data older than `cleanup_prune_keep_days`, keeping only what's needed for recent comparisons.
    3.  **Vacuums the Database:** After cleaning, it runs the `VACUUM` command to physically shrink the database file and reclaim disk space.
-   **Safe by Default:** The `cleanup_execute_on_run: false` setting ensures that your first few runs are a "dry run". Check the AppDaemon logs to see what the script *would have* deleted before you enable it for real.

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

-   **Charts are not updating:**
    - Check the AppDaemon logs for any errors related to `music_tracker`. Errors are usually very descriptive.
    - Ensure your `db_path` and `html_output_path` are correct and that AppDaemon has permission to write to those locations.
    - Manually trigger an update by turning on your helper toggle in **Developer Tools > States**.

-   **The "Update Charts" button doesn't work:**
    - Confirm that `webhook: True` is set in your `apps.yaml`.
    - Double-check that your automation's Webhook ID is **exactly** `Update_Music_Charts`.
    - Open your browser's developer tools (F12) on the charts page, go to the **Console** tab, click the button, and see if any network errors appear.

-   **AI Analysis is missing:**
    - Verify your `ai_service` is correctly configured and that the integration is working in Home Assistant.
    - Check the AppDaemon logs. AI generation can sometimes fail or time out, and the logs will contain the error details.
    - Generating the report can take 30-120 seconds. Be patient after triggering an update.
