## üöÄ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

1.  **Home Assistant:** You must have a working Home Assistant installation.
2.  **AppDaemon Add-on:** You need the [AppDaemon 4.5+](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-appdaemon) add-on installed and running.
3.  **(Optional) Generative AI Integration:** To use the AI analysis feature, you need a working Generative AI integration configured in Home Assistant, such as [Google Generative AI Conversation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation/).

### Step 1: Add the Script

1.  Navigate to your AppDaemon configuration folder (usually `/config/appdaemon/apps`).
2.  Create a new file inside the `apps` folder named `music_tracker.py`.
3.  Copy the entire content of the `music_tracker.py` script and paste it into this new file.

### Step 2: Configure the App

1.  In the `apps` directory, open your `apps.yaml` file.
2.  Add the following configuration block to the file, and customize it to your needs.

```yaml
music_tracker:
  module: music_tracker
  class: MusicTracker
  
  # --- Required Settings ---
  # List of media player entities to monitor
  media_players:
    - media_player.living_room_sonos
    - media_player.kitchen_display
    - media_player.bedroom_speaker
    
  # Path to the database file. A good location is within the appdaemon config folder.
  db_path: "/config/appdaemon/music_data_history.db"

  # Path where the final HTML page will be saved.
  # This MUST be inside your Home Assistant 'www' directory.
  html_output_path: "/config/www/music_charts.html"
  
  # --- Optional & Recommended Settings ---
  # Enable AI-powered analysis reports.
  ai_service: "google_generative_ai_conversation/generate_content" # Set to false to disable
  
  # Run the chart generation when AppDaemon starts.
  run_on_startup: True
  
  # Time of day (24-hour format) to automatically update the charts.
  update_time: "23:59:00"

  # Enable the "Update Charts" button in the web interface.
  # If you set this to True, you MUST complete Step 3 below.
  webhook: True
  
  # --- Fine-Tuning (Advanced) ---
  # How long a song must play (in seconds) to be counted.
  duration: 30
  
  # How many unique songs from an album must be played for it to appear in the charts.
  min_songs_for_album: 4
```
3. In `configuration.yaml` file you need to make sure Home Assistant allows external urls and dirs, for example:
```yaml
homeassistant:
  allowlist_external_urls:
    - http://192.168.86.220:8123
    - http://homeassistant.local:8123

  allowlist_external_dirs:
    - "/config/www"
```
4. Restart Home Assistant (if you modify configuration.yaml file)

### Step 3: (Required if `webhook: True`) Webhook Setup

To use the **"Update Charts"** button on the web page, you need to connect it to a Home Assistant automation. This process links the button press to the AppDaemon script.

#### Part A: Create a Helper Toggle

This toggle acts as the "switch" that the automation will flip to tell the script to run.

1.  In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers**.
2.  Click **Create Helper** and select **Toggle**.
3.  Give it a **Name**, for example, `Music Charts Update`. This will create an entity with an ID like `input_boolean.music_charts_update`. The script will listen for this helper to be turned on.

#### Part B: Create the Automation

This automation will listen for the webhook from the button and flip the toggle you just created.

1.  Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes**.
2.  Click **Create Automation** and choose **Start with an empty automation**.
3.  Give your automation a descriptive name, like "Trigger Music Charts Update".

4.  **Configure the Trigger:**
    - In the **Triggers** section, click **Add Trigger** and select **Webhook**.
    - For the **Webhook ID**, enter `Update_Music_Chats`. **This must match exactly.**

5.  **Configure the Action:**
    - In the **Actions** section, click **Add Action**.
    - Select **Call Service** and choose the service **Input boolean: Turn on** (`input_boolean.turn_on`).
    - For the **Target**, click **Choose entity** and select the `Music Charts Update` toggle you created in Part A.

6.  Click **Save**.

The flow is now complete: Button Press ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Automation Runs ‚Üí Turns on Helper Toggle ‚Üí AppDaemon sees the toggle and updates the charts.

## üñ•Ô∏è Viewing Your Charts

Once the script runs for the first time, you can access your charts page at:

`http://<your-home-assistant-ip>:8123/local/music_charts.html`

-   Replace `<your-home-assistant-ip>` with the IP address of your Home Assistant instance.
-   Bookmark this page or add it as a `webpage` card to your dashboard. It's recomended to use `Pannel (single card)` dashboard for best results.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

-   **Charts are not updating:**
    - Check the AppDaemon logs for any errors related to `music_tracker`.
    - Ensure the `update_time` in `apps.yaml` is a valid "HH:MM:SS" string.
    - Manually trigger an update by turning on your helper toggle (`input_boolean.music_charts_update`) in Home Assistant's developer tools.

-   **"Update Charts" button doesn't work:**
    - Make sure `webhook: True` is set in your `apps.yaml`.
    - Double-check that your Home Assistant automation's Webhook ID is **exactly** `Update_Music_Chats`.
    - Open your browser's developer tools (F12) on the charts page, go to the Console tab, click the button, and see if any errors appear.

-   **AI Analysis is not appearing:**
    - Make sure your `ai_service` is correctly configured in `apps.yaml` and matches an installed and working Generative AI integration.
    - Check the AppDaemon logs. AI generation can sometimes fail or time out. The logs will provide clues.
    - Be patient! Depending on your hardware and the AI service, generating the report can take a minute or two.
